Modern JavaScript from the beginning - all the way up to JS expert level. Edition 2022, lector Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Inspired by the great presentation of Angular I decided to pass another [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) conducted by one of my favorite lectors. 80% of the information is already known, but the rest 20%  will be extremely useful and important addition to my knowledge of beginner developer .
