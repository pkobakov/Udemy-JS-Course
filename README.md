Modern JavaScript from the beginning - all the way up to JS expert level. Edition 2022, lector Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Inspired by the great presentation of Angular I decided to pass another [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) conducted by one of my favorite lectors. More than satisfied . Great lectures and lot of useful information.  Important addition to my knowledge as а beginner developer.
